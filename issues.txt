--->Review BeanDefinition handling for configuration properties
For a "main" bean, we should be using  rather than :



In an arrangement where one is trying to programmatically reproduce such created definitions, it would be much nicer to rely on an attribute rather than on an implementation detail.

Also, having a single instance supplier for both value object and regular bean would avoid to [check if the bean has already been processed]( and would make things more consistent. This also would have the advantage that no attribute is necessary.

--->configuration-processor does not pick up description from javadoc on inherited properties in different Maven modules
Affected version: Spring Boot 2.5.3
Build system: Maven 3.6.9

Consider a class annotated with  extending another class located in a different Maven module in the same reactor, the description (JavaDoc) of the parent class' properties is not picked up by the configuration-processor and therefore not written to spring-configuration-metadata.json.

This is rather unhandy because we generate our configuration documentation out of the spring-configuration-metadata.json.

A sample project can be found here 

Check for  and  in spring-configuration-metadata.json, there's no description but should be.
