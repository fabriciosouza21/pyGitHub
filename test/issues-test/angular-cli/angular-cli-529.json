I've installed it through npm, and the typings, so there are no typescript compiler errors. `ng-serve` runs fine with no errors, but I get the following error in the console:\n\n``` sh\nUnhandled Promise rejection: \"XHR error (404 Not Found) loading http://localhost:4200/markdown-it\n    Error loading http://localhost:4200/markdown-it as \"markdown-it\" from http://localhost:4200/app/ang-cli-test.js\" ; Zone: <root> ; Task: Promise.then ; Value: Error: XHR error (404 Not Found) loading http://localhost:4200/markdown-it\n```\n\nWhich tells me that angular-cli isn't bundling it correctly. \n\nMy import statement is: `import * as markdownIt from 'markdown-it';`, and I said, the typescript compiler is recognizing it. \n\nEnv:\n\n``` sh\n~/git/ang-cli-test$ ng --version\nCould not start watchman; falling back to NodeWatcher for file system events.\nVisit http://www.ember-cli.com/user-guide/#watchman for more info.\nangular-cli: 0.0.33\nnode: 5.10.1\nos: linux x64\n```\n\nThanks.\n",

      "comment":"@jkuri , I didn't see that. I assumed it was just a problem with this library, since I randomly tried `ng install moment` and I didn't need to do any of that.\n\nActually I just looked over the [3rd party libs](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/3rd-party-libs) page, it looks like its out of date. For example, the `system-config.js` file is used now as opposed to the script, and the syntax looks quite different. \n",

The broccoli compiler seems to work fine, but the console in the browser gives the error:\n\n```\nUnhandled Promise rejection: \"XHR error (404 Not Found) loading http://localhost:4200/vendor/markdown-it/markdown.js\n    Error loading http://localhost:4200/vendor/markdown-it/markdown.js as \"markdown-it\" from http://localhost:4200/app/ang-cli-test-2.component.js\"\n```\n\nThe issue seems to be in the `system-config.ts` file:\n\n``` typescript\n// Add your custom SystemJS configuration here.\nexport const config: any = {\n  packages: Object.assign({\n    // Add your custom SystemJS packages here.\n  }, createPackageConfig(barrels)),\n  map: {\n    'markdown-it': 'vendor/markdown-it/markdown.js' \n  }\n};\n```\n\nI've tried lots of combinations of this.
