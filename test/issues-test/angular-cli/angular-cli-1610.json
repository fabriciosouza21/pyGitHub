This may be something as trivial as changing a string, and still seeing the old string shown after a refresh.\r\nThis could either be _compiling_ a wrong (cached) version of the file, or – more likely – _serving_ a stale version.\r\n\r\nI get the feeling we're seeing three different errors:\r\n\r\n1) Changes are not detected. This seems to be what the majority of this thread focuses on.\r\n2) Changes are detected, but a stale version still ends up in the browser after a refresh.\r\n3) Changes to footprint/interfaces are not correctly reloaded.

I suspect the main server process remains in the old outDir. This directory is empty. [ note in my example above I do not cd to a different dir after doing the deletes ]\r\n\r\nWhat I cannot explain, however, is why the new outDir directory contains the contents of the old .js bundles.\r\n\r\nI, too, suspect what @wulfsberg describes - old cached copy is placed into the new outDir instead of the newly compiled bundle(s). Although I cannot conceive of an implementation of ng server that would read the old bundles into memory, compile and build new bundles but then write out the old cached versions. That does not make sense to me. But it seems that indeed that is what is happening.\r\n\r\nI cannot explain this by any technique that uses dir rename and recreate even if a rollback is performed. The new outDir has a different inode. So what I am seeing cannot be due to a dir renaming scheme.\r\n\r\nI tested for and eliminated browser caching as a possibility (used chrome dev tools and turned cache off).\r\n\r\nFor now, I am just using ng build --watch. The issue may be fixed at this point. I simply haven't taken the time to find out.\r\n",

      "comment":"More or less the same issue here: all HTML and CSS files are properly watched, but not the TypeScript files. Whatever the solution applied (removing/reinstalling the `node_modules` folder, using the `--poll` parameter, changing the `inotify` watchers on Linux), nothing has worked. It's probably related to the layout of my project, or the contents of the `tsconfig.json` files, because `ng serve` works as expected on a minimal app generated with `ng new`.\r\n\r\nTested with Node.js 12.2.0 and 12.3.0 on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 19.04: in my case, the issue is clearly not OS-dependant.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.9\r\nNode: 12.3.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.9\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.9\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.9\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n```\r\n",
