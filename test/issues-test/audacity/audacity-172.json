It does so by bundling Audacity and its core dependencies which cannot be expected to be part of each target system (Linux distribution) inside the AppImage.\r\n\r\nThe URL of the AppImage can be found in the Travis CI build log, it is beginning with `http://bintray...`. Of course you can change this to use the GitHub Releases mechanism for hosting the binaries instead.",

AppImage seems like the easiest way for you guys to provide those binaries.

At least now the AppImage build is being reviewed by the people in Audacity who make sure things work well on Linux.

Anyway, appimages is a good option to download binaries and test them on linux.",

I use three opensource applications for video creation namely Audacity, Kdenlive and OBS Studio.\r\n\r\n- Kdenlive already provides AppImages: https://kdenlive.org/en/download/\r\n- OBS is in the process of adopting one: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/2868\r\n\r\nI would love to see Audacity move in this direction. It would help a lot of content creators on Linux to get started with Audacity hassle free!\r\n\r\nLinked https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/695",
