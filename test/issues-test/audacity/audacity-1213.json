It's certainly possible to rewrite features to get a different license. You see this often in BSD world. Whether or not they crossed all their t's and dotted all their i's when doing that would be question for a court, and sadly probably only those smaller contributors would have standing to sue. ",

Personally, I'd like to see this project GPL2 compliant (which means no telemetry, no tracking and certainly no PG-13 rating because of it).\r\n\r\nIn order to be sure that my modifications have no potential side effects or code ignoring the build flags, I've removed all networking related code in my fork, including the Help Menu integrations for Crash Reporting and the Update Manager that is running in the background periodically.\r\n\r\nBut I also wanted to make a fair statement here: The cmake flags hint that Muse Group's intentions were clearly trying to make it opt-in from a maintainer's perspective (Debian/Arch/whatever distro's policies), so I would not use this against them.\r\n\r\nHowever, the license is chosen unwisely in regards to GPL2 compliance (maybe a copy/paste mistake?), and therefore should be checked again with their legal team - as it was the cause of this issue and the rising internet rage over at HackerNews and Reddit.\r\n\r\nI'd also prefer that even when the package maintainer has decided to include tracking options that there would be a dialog in the beginning, asking the user whether or not they want to opt-in to those separately, each able to be deselected or selected.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, and having seen the actual codebase without making irrelevant claims, I think the intent of the Muse Group was not malicious here; and it seems more to be a simple copy/paste mistake of another license they were using for other software they owned/published before.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Not associated in any form with Muse Group, not a lawyer, just a concerned European citizen.\r\n",

[At least one author](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/od3h8b/audacity_may_collect_data_necessary_for_law/h3zca9f/) intentionally put flaws in their tabs as 'watermarks', and those ended up in the final copies they claimed wasn't from the community. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of shady business going on here, with the various projects being swallowed up and put under the Muse Group umbrella, from the copyright assignment enforcement through to the changes in Audacity and the forked version of the wxWidgets library needed to build it. \r\n\r\nIt's time to start putting Audacity and similar apps under an AppArmor profile that restricts what they can do; read, write and ZERO network access permitted.

There's probably revenue streams tied back to feeding the data to law enforcement as well, that they'll lose out on. \r\n\r\nA fork, while undesirable in almost every case of an OSS project, is sometimes necessary to ensure the spirit and law of the licenses is respected. The problem with a fork in _this_ specific case, is that the main developers and copyright holders already signed over their rights to the Muse Group through a [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/), and will likely not contribute to a forked version as well. \r\n\r\nThis means any fork would have to find the same level of development skills/resources, as well as _interest_ in continuing a fork, in order for that fork to survive and replace the one Muse is proposing. \r\n\r\nNote: There are already [1.2k forks of the main audacity repository](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/network/members) already, many probably resulting from this news, so the codebase can be preserved before it moves under a Private repository.

This issue went long past \"valid feedback\", again, *this is not a chatroom*.\n\nMy own main concern here is that the privacy policy suggests \"law enforcement cooperation\" and that part is unclear to me and I'd like the reason for the inclusion of that clause in an offline software to be laid out first before I can draw any subsequent conclusions. Is it a copypasted legal generic? Is this a ContentID in the making? We don't know.\n\nMost of what I see here stems from the following: when an entity acquires a codebase or some part of it, the entity is subject to international and local laws. Therefore the clauses that outline these interactions with governments appear in policies. When a project is maintained independently and no profit is involved, from a government standpoint it's an individualistic international swarm. With the acquisition a singular entity is now responsible for everything the software does or is and that entity needs to cover its legal bases.\n\nWhat is needed here is clear communication of what exactly called for these privacy policy clauses and what kind of data exactly it covers. Telemetry is a good thing if done right, but it needs to be done *extremely right*. So far it is a PR void which is not a good look.\n\nNeed detailed answers.",

There's probably revenue streams tied back to feeding the data to law enforcement as well, that they'll lose out on.\r\n> \r\n> A fork, while undesirable in almost every case of an OSS project, is sometimes necessary to ensure the spirit and law of the licenses is respected. The problem with a fork in _this_ specific case, is that the main developers and copyright holders already signed over their rights to the Muse Group through a [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/), and will likely not contribute to a forked version as well.\r\n> \r\n> This means any fork would have to find the same level of development skills/resources, as well as _interest_ in continuing a fork, in order for that fork to survive and replace the one Muse is proposing.\r\n> \r\n> Note: There are already [1.2k forks of the main audacity repository](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/network/members) already, many probably resulting from this news, so the codebase can be preserved before it moves under a Private repository.\r\n\r\nWell, some are from round 1 of this crap with the pull request for google analytics and yandex we said, yah, nope. To be honest I would prefer any fork start there to make sure we have it all and carefully cherrypick commits back in.\r\n\r\nI also want to have a closer look at that new \"utility library\" wx replacement.

Trademark, in this case, would refer to the similarity in the same industry (audio enthusiasts, bands, musicians), and not to the logo itself (which itself, can be trademarked separately from its name).\r\n> \r\n> If Muse has registered a trademark for the name and logo \"Audacity\", then all bets on using \"Audacitium\" are off. Using your trademark does not protect you from someone else in the same industry using your name or logo, but _registering_ your trademark does.\r\n> \r\n> Here's where things get tricky: If the original creators of the Audacity name or logo, did not sign the CLA, and only the developers did, and Muse tries to use their original creation, such as the project's logo, and use it as their own, they can be sued over the misuse of your copyright, but only if you have a copyright registration legally filed.\r\n> \r\n> Many to most OSS projects don't go the extra step of filing for copyright protection with the US Copyright Office, but some do.\r\n> \r\n> Before you go starting with new logos and names, that foundation should be established, and if Muse hasn't filed them, the project's developers should, to prevent Muse from using their name not in good faith with the industry that supported the project up to this point.\r\n> \r\n> But circling back, the code, developers and community has to be established first, and at that point it's wise to choose a name, because you'll have a new direction, new charter and new leadership for the project.\r\n\r\nUnder trademark law, it has to be confusingly similar. As in average joe on the street would thing \"Audactitium\" is \"Audacity\" from MuseGroup (the from is important here as \"Trademarks are source identifiers of goods\").\r\n\r\nOn the copyright issue, that very much depends on country one is in. In most countries there is no such registration requirement, that is a US thing. A problematic one as other parts of the law make it clear copyright attaches with \"fixing in a tangible medium\".

I'm not heavily involved in audio work, so I've only used Audacity intermittently over the years.  But it's been very helpful when I've needed it.\r\n\r\nBut I'm leaving for, and financially supporting, a fork because you and Muse have **told me to leave**.  My current use case for Audacity is helping my 9 year old son record and mix his own music, and according to your new privacy policy, that's not allowed.\r\n\r\nIf you're feeling surprised by the level of venom these changes have provoked, it's because Muse's actions are massively violating community norms.  The age issue is just one of these: I cut my teeth on Slackware GNU/Linux back in the 90s when I was still in high school, and I'm sure many others here did too.  Applying privacy-invading analytics and a minimum age to a Free Software project feels like a slap in the face.\r\n\r\n> Why was such a thing added, and why wasn't it deleted as soon as anyone read it?\r\n\r\n@differentprogramming if I had to guess - no-one read it.

The GPL also states that any restrictions placed are invalid and can be removed or ignored without changing the licensing.\r\n\r\nSo first, it is a violation of the GPL to put an age restriction on the software.  There is no law requiring Muse to add anything to the software that requires an age restriction, thus adding that is completely voluntary, and the subsequent requirement to add the age restriction is actually not a requirement but is rather completely voluntary.  As such, the law does not protect them from litigation over the GPL violation.\r\n\r\nSecond, because the GPL explicitly and automatically invalidates and removes any restrictions to use, the age restriction is completely invalid and meaningless.  Legally, this means that it _cannot_ protect Muse, if people 13 and under choose to use Audacity, and they end up collecting data on them.  \"Oh, we had a restriction\" won't hold up in court, when the license explicity invalidates and removes all restrictions.\r\n\r\nIn short, they are trying to cover their butts, but not only are they violating the license terms _they agreed to as a condition of distributing to the software_, they are also totally _failing_ to _actually_ cover their butts.

However it's established under law that an open source license is a contract in the US.  That means provisions of a license are null and void when competing against an established law (in this case 16 CFR Part 312).  When that part of the contract is stuck down by existing law there can be no violation of the contract.  Specifically forbidding young users and having a dialog has been found to be sufficient to comply with COPPA.  Law trumps contract terms every single time.  Of course if you have some case law where the GPL supersedes established law I'm all ears.  \r\n\r\nAs for someone litigating Muse over GPL violations the chances are slim and none.  FIrst, someone would need standing.  Perhaps a contributor.  Not a user.  Second, and more important, you would need assloads of cash.  Well into six figures just to start.

So by adding PII data collection to Audacity, Muse has rendered it _not Free or Open Source Software_.  It no longer complies with the GPL (at least in the US, where COPPA trumps GPL), and it no longer meets the OSI's definition of Open Source.\r\n\r\nI'd not given this much thought before now, but I suppose this means that software cannot both be Free or Open Source, _and_ collect PII by default.  At least not in jurisdictions with COPPA or similar.\r\n\r\nEdited: Thinking on this some more, it'd seems like COPPA compliance would be achieved by just making the analytics opt-in, right?

I am suggesting that the GPL _invalidates the defense the age restriction is supposed to create_.\r\n\r\nThe point of the age restriction is that _when_ users 13 years old and under use the software, resulting in Muse collecting their data (which I think we all know _is going to happen_), Muse can claim that _they_ are not liable, because the data was collected as a result of _user_ violation of the license.  _However,_ because the GPL explicitly nullifies the age restriction, that defense cannot hold, because the user _didn't_ violate the license, because the age restriction _wasn't valid in the first place_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the FFS _does_ keep open source lawyers on hand specifically for litigating GPL violations.  They typically save their resources for cases that are high profile, likely to result in permanent changes to the law (ie., could get to the Supreme Court or some other high court), or are such clear violations that they would be easy to win and set precedents supporting elements of the GPL that haven't already been tested in court.

      "comment":"So you are suggesting that the 242 stars on your fork are more likely to have a solid community than the 3.7k on the other?  Would you care to explain why you are so convinced that so many more of those 242 people will stick around than the 3.7k?  By my math, 93% of those 3.7k could bail out, and it would _still have_ more people than your measly 242, if you didn't lose a single one.\r\n\r\nSure, popularity doesn't indicate staying power, _but we are talking about the exact same product_.  I am going to back the more popular one, because higher popularity does indicate _far higher **odds** of staying_.  You've got 13 forks.  That's 13 potential contributors.  The other has 165 forks, which is 165 potential contributors.  Again, over 90% could bail out on the more popular one, and they would still have a bigger core developer pool than yours will have if _no one_ bails out.\r\n\r\nIt's all about probability.  Popularity may not indicate staying power, but it _does correlate with staying power_.  And given that this correlation is the only metric we have for estimating staying power, the evidence strongly suggests the more popular one has well over 10 times the probability of sticking around.  That is, unless you have some inside information about both of these that I don't?...  I didn't think so.",

      "comment":"This is a valid argument.  It's definitely not clear where users will be on this.  That said, the Tenacity fork has a _strong_ head start.  The question right now isn't so much whether the community will get behind them.  The community will probably back whichever gets into the major Linux distros first (and the distro decision makes are devs, so devs will ultimately be the ones making the final call).  The question is going to be, can they maintain the momentum?  Their odds are much higher than other forks with only 5% of the support, but all it would take is a few bad decisions by fascist project leads, and we could see the same mass exodus we are seeing for Audacity.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, very much in the air.  But, if I _had_ to bet, I would bet on the one with 3.7k stars over the one with less than 250.  More people means more people likely to stay, more room for community involvement and feedback (because more community overall), and more people to contribute.  I think what it comes down to is that Tenacity is _going_ to win this, unless people with authority over the repo _really screw it up_.

That's part of what GPL means. Muse may, if they've secured all the relevant copyrights to all the existing code in Audacity, choose to also put out a non-GPL release that's proprietary software and they can ban minors under 13 from using that all they want.
