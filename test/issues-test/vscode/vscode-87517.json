Christmas is one of the most prominent such tradition that has transcended religion for hundreds of years. To make it even more prominently less religious, the \"santa hat\" has zero connection to religion again - it is attributed to depictions of Saint Nicholas, who, while is a Christian saint, has gotten famous not for being Christian, not for following Jesus and spreading his word, but for being generally a good person, giving out gifts.

It was not a swastika, it was not \"Heil Hitler\" playing on a loop, it was not a manifesto to encourage creation and operation of another Auschwitz. Comparing it to them is just as disrespectful to the victims of the Holocaust than outright denying it happened. When everything, even a little santa hat, suddenly equals the Holocaust, it loses its significance. Yes, keep remembering people it happened so we never repeat such a horror, but do not diminish its effects, and compare it to an effin' santa hat.\r\n\r\nSo please, let's keep politically correct bullshit out of this app. It's a tool. It's not a political platform.\r\n\r\nAlso, if he can be offended by the addition of the santa hat, I can be offended by the removal. Pushing religious propaganda is completely unacceptable.

Without them we would all live better.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft that simply makes an act showing the hat of a Coca Cola character (the original Santa Claus was not red) to remember the time of festivities of a great majority of the planet and some only know how to think about genocides.\r\n\r\nIf so, that user won't use [VideoLan](https://github.com/videolan) to watch his videos either, since it also shows the Coca-Cola Santa's hat.  He should go open a complaint to the VideoLan repository as well.\r\n\r\nLet's see if humanity has already overcome its problems and left behind the mistakes it has made.\r\n\r\n",

Microsoft's unwillingness of leaving the discussion open is what's prompting these tickets to be opened. Just like how said sad person had the right to express his opinion about the topic (even if it was based on totally skewed material and false equals), we, the other users also have the right to express our opinion about him. Microsoft choosing to side with him, and practically silence every opposing opinion is something that should not happen in the open software segment. It says that that one person's opinion is more important than the other users', and by acting so quickly, locking down any further discussion, just shows that Microsoft is either ignorant enough to believe falsified historical documents and twisted out facts, or outright they agree with it. Neither is acceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd to focus on what matters... This matters. Because this is a slippery slope, and listening to a single users' complaints, then ignoring hundreds of others is a bad practice, and should be pointed out.",

Please make the re-addition of the santa hat your top priority!\r\n> \r\n> Sincerely: an atheist\r\n\r\nObviously, I agree with you that VSCode is not a political or religious platform. Therefor I opened that issue. Thus, you calling me a religious extremist while being part in some of the most extremist behavior I have seen to date is rather irrational. This begins to look a bit like the reaction in relation to the Muhammed drawings, only I as opposed to those who did that, I did not in any way mock your religion, I just stated that such symbols, religious and otherwise have no place in a professional dev environment and documented that said symbol has a long history of being used in hate crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\n\r\nTherefor, I understand this as yet another spam issue related to me opening issue microsoft/vscode#87268 on the santa hat. If these kinds of spam comments and bad jokes were all that it was, we could all have a good laugh together. Yet, even if that were the case, the sheer magnitude of such spam alone borders to harassment. Unfortunately, spammy issue openings and comments like yours were pretty much the best of them.\r\n\r\nResponses ranging from racist name calling including n and k words, forcing your religion down my throat by spamming my repositories and personal email account with Santa’s, Jesus loves you and merry xmas comment, DDOS attacks on my dev server attempts to hack my dev server, registering with my email on diverse porn and sex and gay dating sites as well as spammer networks, opening fake issues and sending emails to my personal account with disgusting photos such as a Santa making the Hitler Salute even one of the GitHub users sending me an email showing his rectum, opened wide, mind you, Hitler salutes all the way to suggestion I should go and kill myself as well as outright death threats and incitement to genocide. And then on top of it all, opening issues with complaint about me practically claiming I forced them to utter those incitements against me, people of color, Jews and others by opening issue #87268 . I mean c'mon, are these people for real?\r\n\r\nOne would think that developers at the very least would have some deductive reasoning, so using the n and k word against me, when my profile picture and name clearly show I am neither, is clearly yet another example of the irrational, homicidal and even genocidal reactions and behaviours many have exhibited in the aftermath. \r\n\r\nUnderstand, I am just a dev who is trying to do the right thing and my complaint about that religious symbolism on globally available software that has nothing to do with religion whatsoever, is completely out of place as well as pointing out that the particular religious symbol, the Santa hat has been used in xmas traditions over the centuries to mock, tarnish, murder and torture people, especially Jews thus for many is a frightening symbol almost as bad as the swastika. I also added a link to document this. Microsoft of course understood that their well-meant holiday greeting has diverse effects on diverse population and ethnic groups and that some of us do not feel particularly happy about getting such symbols forced down our throats and that some even experience fear and anxiety due to some of the historic meaning of xmas including its symbolism as said Santa hat.\r\n\r\nNow, I was not surprised that not everyone agreed with my concern, yet given I felt I explained why and documented it well, I would have expected supposedly intelligent fellow developers to show understanding and respect for my position. Now a friendly little tarnish against me here and there, while not necessarily nice or even appropriate in this context, I would have accepted and not even bothered to comment upon, much less send abuse complaints about, but this aforementioned hate fest that came in the aftermath, is not only completely unacceptable, some of it in fact not only regular criminal offences, some of the offences are outright crimes against humanity, especially those containing incitement to genocide against a protected group. \r\n\r\nThe aforementioned hates fest by the way also proves the absolute necessity to keep dev apps and networks as well other professional apps and networks free of political and religious symbolism, apparently especially xmas related symbolism since history in fact did repeat itself and I for some reason became a proxy for the hate these people have for people of color and Jews. I can only imagine how those groups must feel, I after all have only been subject to this for the third day now, the groups in question however must live with this their whole lives. So, think people and stop this madness. It most certainly is not funny, not funny at all.\r\n\r\nAs to people claiming Santa is not a religious symbol, the kind of murderous and genocidal rage some of you exhibited in the aftermath, very similar to the type of murderous and genocidal rage of old inn relation to xmas, in most cases are exhibited solely by religious and political extremists, so based on that, I am going to have to beg to differ.\r\n\r\nNow Microsoft has changed the symbol into something that is optional, great, I guess everyone now should be happy and be able to go on with their lives. I also hope, that this unbelievable terror some of you have subjected Jews, people of color and other groups as well as me to in the aftermath now has come to an end and that if anyone feels the need to send yet another message in this matter, that massage will be a message of either support or an apology for past behavior. An apology I would suggest many of you ow the Jewish People, People of Color, Microsoft as well as myself.\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays.\r\n",

The swastika is a symbol connected to a movement about hate and genocide while a Santa hat is simply not even a religious symbol for the majority of people. As one user mentioned, the reason the Santa hat is even red is due to a marketing campaign by Coca Cola. Microsoft's inclusion of the Santa hat was not for religious reasons at all like you falsely claim, it was (as they stated) a wholesome festive easter egg that was included as a lead up to the holidays.\r\n\r\nWell history did indeed repeat itself, you being a part of that, thus your own behavior disproves your argument.",

What really grinds my gears though, is how fast M$ bowed to his unreasonable demands. That is a perfect example of what is wrong with the world today. How one miserable individual can spread his own hate and misery to the rest of the world using the shield and sward of \"social justice\" and employ companies as M$ for his cause.

      "comment":"@Christian-Schiffer it's all about being both normal and social.\r\n\r\nYou see, a normal person finds Santa's hat to be a delightful symbol of family reunion. I'm an atheist, I don't celebrate Christmas and neither does my family, we all celebrate New Year. And Santa (or a local equivalent) has been a symbol for winter festivities for all normal people throughout the last millenium or so, independent of the religion. If it hurts you (which I actually doubt), you are not normal. \r\n\r\nBut being anormal is totally fine by itself! Let me draw a very rough analogy here.\r\n\r\nYou work in a giant company with hundreds of coworkers. Most of them celebrate and have fun during winter festive times. They all decorate their offices and have fun together. Also, someone puts a pine tree with some decorations (no religious symbols or anything like that) near the entrance. You don't celebrate any holidays of wintery kind. This makes you anormal, but nobody is blaming you for not having fun. What you should do is walk past the tree and get back to work. What you choose to do is cut down the tree with help from the boss, and then argue with all of your colleagues about how Christmas is actually Holocaust and christmas tree reminds you of dead people. This is awful, don't you think?\r\n\r\n What you should have done is ignore the icon and move on with your life. That would have been the normal social choice. Instead you chose to ruin the festive attitude of every developer who saw these threads. After the massive backlash of the community, instead of moving on with your life, you are continuing to ruin the fun. This behavior is antisocial and it clearly indicates that either you really have some psychological problems (in which case, I'm really sorry for you and wish you to disconnect from the internet for a while and get better) or you are outright trolling/attention whoring. In both cases, I think you should stop this.",

I doubt there are many (if any at all) people left, that still celebrate Christmas by torturing people, or even celebrating it for the fact, that that was done in the past.\r\n\r\nThe analogy the article you linked to pulled, by claiming that it's similar as if we still celebrated Hitler's Birthday is nonsensical. Hitler's birthday would be celebrated for, well, Hitler. \r\nChristmas is being celebrated because Jesus was born - a Semite himself.\r\nYes it's primarily celebrated by Christians, but that hardly adds anything to the point. It is not unique to that group of people, many people of different beliefs take part in the holiday: Atheists, Agnostics, Christians, Muslims, Jews, etc.\r\nAnd Santa Claus, or even more specifically - Santa's hat is **not** a religious symbol. It's a pagan symbol, the colours were even influenced by Coca Cola (iirc.).\r\nYes, St. Nicholas is a Christian figure, but there are other characters Santa Claus is based on.\r\nAnd to my best of knowledge, St. Nicholas had nothing to do with Jews or any form of torture whatsoever.\r\nSanta never hurt a Jew, he couldn't if he tried since he doesn't exist. And Christmas wasn't celebrated as what your article rightfully points out ever since Santa Clause was a thing.\r\n\r\nAgain, you're free to dislike it as you please, but expecting a change affecting millions in something so subliminal, simply because it goes against your own beliefs is presumptuous, as far as I'm concerned.",

I also opened the ticket because Microsoft took a \"discussion closed\" stance, which is clearly not the case.\r\n\r\nYou also accuse people who oppose your opinion, of being Nazis. I hope you realise that doing so in a public forum, especially in such baseless situations, can be considered as defamation. As I have made absolutely NO point that would indicate me as a Nazi, this is your final warning - continue this, and the next email you'll be receiving won't be a bunch of Santa hats and \"merry Christmas\", but either one from my lawyer, or a court summon. Labeling people Nazis just because they disagree with you is NOT OKAY. Labeling an international, non-religious figure as Nazi is also not okay. Comparing the santa hat to a swastika is definitely NOT OKAY. Hope you finally understand this.\r\n\r\nAnd while I disagree with your point, and the way you presented it, I also disagree with the people who have threatened you, or sent distasteful/hateful emails that are clearly visible in your new profile picture. Please note that I never encouraged it, nor did I partake in this. My point with this post did not aim to discredit the Jewish religion, it was not against Jews, it was against the perceived religious extremism you presented with your demand and false equivalence. Had you debated the topic in a sane manner (again, comparing the santa hat - a symbol that even YOUR OWN SOURCE names as a commercial icon attributed to Coca Cola, and NOT Christianity) - to the swastika is either insane or extreme religious zealotry), had you not demanded but requested, this whole shitstorm wouldn't be happening. However you, even after realising WHY the attacks were going on, decided to double down on the manner and behaviour instead of trying to find common ground. This is not \"preventing evil from prevailing\", this is, as I stated before, religious zealotry - something that has no place in the open software world. The moment religion dictates software (either pro or contra), it loses its open and free nature, which is the only evil that can happen here.\r\n\r\n> For in a world were people not in your mainstream accepted cultural and political and religious agenda are being intimidated to bow down, shut up, hide, in that world, I do not care to live at all, so go ahead, bring it! \r\n\r\nAnd in a world where a religious zealot (or troll) can dictate, alone, what's offensive and what isn't, I do not care to partake, however I will fight till the end to preserve the religion-free state of software.\r\n\r\n> As to Santa being a religious symbol, for many it is, for others it may not be, for other again it is a symbol of hate and fear, it most certainly has become a symbol of hate for me the last couple of days.\r\n\r\nExcept Santa, I repeat again, is NOT a religious symbol. How many times do I have to go over this? Santa is not part of any Christian scripture, the Bible, or any teachings. It is an amalgamation of various legendary figures, such as Odin, St. Nicholas (who was indeed a Christian bishop, though that's not the significant part of him that got included in the final image), Father Christmas (again, not a Christian entity, but a local folclore), and a bunch of other similar characters from Germanic, Dutch, and even Anglican folclore. It's religious significance is so little that while Vatican accepted it as part of the culture, it was never made part of Christianity.\r\n\r\nAnd let me remind you that the decision if something is a religious icon or not is not up to you, who do not even practice said religion - just because you claim it to be, it doesn't suddenly magically become so. I could claim that hummus is a Jewish religious symbol, and that it offends me, and I want it removed from all western restaurants. This claim is just as sane as yours - i.e. not at all.\r\n",

That is how much you have intimidated people by your racist homicidal and genocidal rage.\r\n\r\nHave you considered for a moment that the reason your suggestions were so heavily downvoted was not because people were \"too intimidated by the homicidal and genocidal racists\" to vote positively, but rather, that they objectively thought that your suggestions were not very good?\r\n\r\nOr do you mean to say that it's racist or antisemetic to disagree with your personal opinions and ideas?",

It it this one here, where I had to take down my own image since it is being spread all over the internet? See that particular picture is a screenshot of the very hate messages I received from some of the users here. So, Yes, I most certainly agree that that their messages are completely unacceptable. If that is what you refer to I wonder what this is about? Do you want me to be silent about the abuse people here have subjected me to in the aftermath, take it an shut up, go quietly into the night? Silent Night? Is that it? As to people not belonging in this or any other community, I would suggest that those who sent me those messages are the ones that do not belong anywhere in any community, not I.",

I had never expected such a thing. especially not here. I have gained so much more respect these day for Jews and other groups being persecuted in this way their whole lives. Unbelievable. And now you ask me to feel sorry that those attacking me and whole protected group with oftentimes nothing less than homicidal and genocidal rage? Do I understand you correctly? Are they the victims now?\r\n\r\nI must say though, as @Folling said, such things do not belong in any community, let alone this one.

It seems that y'all are attacking this guy because he has a different opinion to yourself, which is not going to get anywhere, as everyone has different opinions.\r\n\r\nThe true issue we should be highlighting here is how Microsoft dealt with this.\r\ni.e. when @kieferrm very promptly said\r\n> @Christian-Schiffer we're sorry we hurt your and other's feelings. We'll remove the Santa Hat.\r\n\r\nThis seems like the wrong approach by Microsoft. And it would be nice to get a reason / get the change rolled back for why this happened in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be up to the community to deal with this, especially not in the way that you guys have. I feel ashamed of the Typescript community in acting in such a way.
