Looking at your screenshot it appears that your star colors are different and am wondering if that's from a different theme or different VS Code version?\r\n\r\nHi @misolori, maintainer of the PowerShell extension here. The contribution point of that icon is `extensionIcon.starForeground`, which is not set in [our theme](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/master/themes/theme-psise/theme.json). Since both the default theme of VS Code (Light+) and our extension's contributed theme (ISE) both use the same background here (#FFFFFF, also not overridden), I believe your fix should take care of it for everyone that isn't explicitly overriding the start foreground. For what it's worth, we do not know which version of Code nor which theme was applied in the original screenshot, but the area of concern is using the defaults of Code either way. Thanks so much!",

Our default icon color passes the color contrast ratio right now, the original screenshot looked like an outdated version. I think we are all good now üëç ",
