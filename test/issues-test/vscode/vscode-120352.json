Open a .ps1 file to start the PowerShell integrated console\r\n4. Paste `invoke-pester ./Samples/demoIssue1891.tests.ps1 -FullNameFilter \"get-emoji\" -Output Diagnostic`\r\n5. Add another double-quote after `get-emoji` so it becomes `...meFilter \"get-emoji\"\" -Output....`. Problem will hopefully occur.\r\n",

It's then when it's almost certain to show up the moment I start using the terminal window. I've tried to systematically type specific keys to see if they are linked but it still ends up being random. \n\nSometimes it'll just throw a few random characters, and I'll be able to delete them continue debugging for a little bit, other times the moment it starts it's an endless stream and I have to kill the window.

I have to delete all the randomly generated characters from the current line and then Clear-Host to regain control of the console. Failure to do this will result in it starting again.
