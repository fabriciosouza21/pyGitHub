      "comment":"I've just published such [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-install-vsix).\r\n\r\nBut IMHO the UX is sub-optimal. Since there's no API for triggering an installation programmatically the extension calls `code --install-extension /path/to/extension.vsix` in a terminal. This approach as a few problems:\r\n- The user must have the `code` command installed\r\n- There's basically no way of knowing if the installation succeeded or not\r\n- It can't show the information message prompting for a restart right after the `code` command terminated, because there's basically no way of knowing when it terminated.\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reasons you don't want to include a feature like this, couldn't you implement an API for installing extensions so that this feature can be implemented properly?",

Opening the `.vsix` extension from the OS's file explorer, with VSCode set as the handler for that file type\r\n\r\n... because those would be really handy too.",

      "comment":"Maybe slightly off-topic, but is there any possibility that double-clicking a vsix on Windows can be \"fixed\"? It's confusing and people seem to skip over the instructions on the page they download vsix from... It'd be nice if Code has its own file extension (even if it's the same file), or a future VS update could be taught how to handle these better (currently you get a nice big error/stack on the screen).",
