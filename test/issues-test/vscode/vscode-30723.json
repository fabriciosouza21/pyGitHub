I presume it's because you're using this milestone for both recovery releases. Whether it's worth changing things to fix this (eg. having two recover release milestones) I don't know; I just wanted to make sure you understood why people are thinking cases are resolved in 1.14.1 that are not :-)",

I don't personally\nhave the insight to do so.  But the current state of \"closed\" is not an\naccurate reflection of \"files.excludes for sub-folders no longer works\" and\nis confusing to anyone currently having trouble with the files.excludes\nsetting.\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 8, 2017 at 10:26 AM, Rob Lourens <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Here you are doing a search, originally you were seeing the files show up\n> in the file explorer.\n>\n> ‚Äî\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30723#issuecomment-320990909>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADpFckrTrT83T4ERYtZt5gXHzYMMGdL_ks5sWH4ggaJpZM4OYb9a>\n> .\n>\n",
