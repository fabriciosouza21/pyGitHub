I just downloaded VSCode on Windows and this is one of the first problems I ran into.\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't VSCode default to the system scroll setting from the OS like all other apps?  My old version of Outlook 2010 does it right, why can't VSCode?\r\n\r\nI set the `editor.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity` to what I wanted.  Great for the editor window, but the other windows: Explorer, Problems, Console, etc. still operate at a sensitivity of 1 (seriously? c'mon man!)\r\n\r\n",

I figured it out, the configuration name has changed, it is now named `terminal.integrated.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity`. But it is actually a multiplier and not a lines, the actual number of scrolling lines for me is `mouseWheelScrollSensitivity` * 6, I don't know what the 6 value is and where it comes from. This may still be a bug that needs to be fixed.",
