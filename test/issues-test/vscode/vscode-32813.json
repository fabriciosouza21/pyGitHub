This would allow the scenario here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34411#issue-257879258\r\n\r\nIn theory I could use an SVG image, with colors pulled from the css variables, allowing me to get theme adaptable icons into the hovers.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nFYI, this is similar to this request https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41785, but not just for the webview, for the editor itself.",

      "comment":"Hi,\r\nI am working on a PR for ![LaTeX-Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop), a VSCode extension for LaTeX editing. In the PR, I make a latex preview in hover available rendering math equations in SVG format with MathJax and embedding the dataurl of generated SVG into a markdown text as an image source. \r\n\r\nWhen rendering math equations, I have to tell MathJax which color to use for each rendering. Otherwise rendered equations are invisible on a certain theme.  To work around the lack of color API in VSCode, I have to render equations in a WebView process, not in an extension process because we can know colors form css variables in the WebView process, as suggested by @eamodio. So when LaTeX-Workshop users close a WebView pane, my PR does not work. For LaTeX-Workshop users, opening a WebView pane as a pdf viewer is a usual thing. So the lack of color api seems to be a minor thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same can be said for other documents having TeX-like equations. Docstring in python, for example. Let's think about API documents with math equations written in docstring. Python libraries should have tons of such API documents. If we want to render equations in them with MathJax, and to display them with API documents in hover, the same problem happens. And, for python programmers while coding, opening a WebView pane is an unusual thing. \r\n\r\nPlease notice that, for this purpose, extensions don't have to listen to theme changes. Equations are dynamically rendered each time. MathJax is enough fast to do that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOn a light theme.\r\n\r\n![oct-13-2018 10-46-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10665499/46900058-027f7c80-ced7-11e8-89aa-cfbdcc942098.gif)\r\n\r\nOn a dark theme.\r\n\r\n![oct-13-2018 10-48-16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10665499/46900064-0c08e480-ced7-11e8-9286-8a727d3d94b9.gif)\r\n",

It was mentioned above a number of times that an extension developer can define colors that then the user may customize, but the user can't customize even base colors without hardcoding them in a way that's not relative to the current theme (which may and often changes during a session). Some months ago the ability to define customizations for several themes at once (including a new wildcard syntax) was added, but the underlying problem of not being able to reference theme attributes (mostly but not only colors) by symbolic names still makes it very hard to maintain customizations beyond two or three themes.",

The Token Colors (colors for each SQL word the user types in) are hardcoded based on Light and Dark themes. To determine if a Theme is Dark or Light, I get the background color for the current theme, calculate its Hue value, then depending on the result I switch the Token Colors. Of course the ideal scenario would be to get the Token Colors for the current theme, but since this is not available, this solution \"kind\" works. I tested with lots of themes and it looks acceptable.\r\nI could also let the user manually customize the Token Colors applied to Monaco, but this would bring a lot of overhead to the code, which is not really necessary. Hopefully one day vscode team will give us these tokens :D\r\nOBS: To get the background color of the current theme, I'm using the approach I mentioned above.\r\n",
