The conversion worked quite well and we were able to side load VS Code as a Windows Store application with no loss of functionality.\r\nSo, this closes the investigation for the product itself. The next investigation we would need to do is understand how to adapt our internal build systems to produce daily/monthly builds that can be published through the Store. Once that is understood, we will decide if and when it makes sense to move forward with this effort and actually put it on the backlog.\r\n\r\nNow that Microsoft is moving forward with a low-cost platform that only features applications from the Windows Store, the time has really come to address this. For me personally, Visual Studio Code is the only non-Store application I use on a regular basis. For the next generation of coders that will be teaching themselves the practice on these sub $300 machines, we owe it to them to have a solid code editor accessible to them.\r\n",

Where they draw the line seems uncertain at this point and could well change so it is hard to predict the impact on VSC.\r\n\r\nThey might do it in a way that allowed Electron apps that only used local content, but even that would not be ideal for VSC.\r\n\r\nBut maybe this isn't so terrible in the end.  VSC as an electron app was never ideal.  It would be much better if Windows 10 exposed API's that allowed Electron apps to use the platform's Edge browser engine rather then bundling its own browser components.  And as Edge gets closer to catching up with Chrome/V8 (leaving aside MS's seeming aversion to the Web Componenet API's) that ideal gets closer.  I've always assumed that that (and using VSC as a service from Azure) was part of the VSC 'master plan'.\r\n\r\nAnd that would provide an efficient way for all Electron apps (lets not forget about slack, after all) to reach 10 S.\r\n\r\nIf the need to make VSC available to Win10 S pushes that forward then VSC and 10 S are both the better for it IMO.",

These issues would result in the 10 S version of Code being very stripped-down or simply a front-end to a cloud service.

It is the stores policy to not use web technologies other than EdgeHtml and Charka, thus why we can't get chrome and Firefox in the store (for security reasons). However, if that can be ported to use them, I don't see how it violates store policy and should work assuming you have external tools (nodejs, etc) installed separately, it just a matter of piping commands around, and communicating with them. As for getting it to work in Windows 10 S, I see limited success, because all the languages services require node.js to run things like tsserver.js for TypeScript language support. However, who's to say that you can't have a client profile, where all your node.js services, etc are remotely executed and results are sent over the wire.",

That way you don't really need anything but a web browser and ms would be happy because more people will utilise Onedrive and other online office tools on live.com. Judging that MS would like to expand windows S like google it will probably rely on online apps like google with chrome OS which makes visual studio code online on live.com the most likely option.

I like to think of it as docker for client apps **(on Windows anyways).** It's clean install/uninstall, no custom third party installer logic, and it's safer to run everything in a compartmentalized, well partitioned sandboxes, unlike the current process where everything has access to just about anything on your system and can mess stuff up, even if well intentioned. I think one of the huge blockers to this is interop with node.js. But as far as being useless, I think that is a stretch. I think the goal here is to transition to secure by default. VS code is already cross platform, and adding to xbox and other very constrained platforms can only be considered after we first take care of the first part.

There is one oddity though that isn't really talked about, the store vs distributing outside the store via .appx file type instead of .msi and .exe. I think all websites should offer .appx files for Windows 10 and .msi or .exe for Windows 8.1 and older. The benefits I mentioned above https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10759#issuecomment-306465609 explains my reasoning; however, once it's distributable via .appx, there is little friction to go all the way and make it a store app, but allow people to get it outside the store in container (.appx) format as well. I'm not a big fan of the store, mostly because it's hard to roll back to a version that works when something breaks, and those times when an app gets discontinued and now I don't have a local copy I can install myself.

I believe you can still certify your appx file and having it cross signed by Microsoft and not deploy it in the store. I think it's a poor excuse to say if you don't want it in the store, then you can't use our container technology, and here is old fashioned .msi installer that will eventually break or at the very least clutter up your system. I don't have an Azure AD Business or Education account, nor do I want it or can afford it at this time, yet I would like to get the other benefits that the OS provides.\r\n\r\nEven if the .appx can't pass store certification, it's still better than an .msi installer. I feel that there should be no excuse for every single non-service or system driver based windows application running on Windows 10 to not be able to be containerized. Even those non-qualifying applications can be broken into two pieces; client containerized app, and the non-UI services and system drivers. This is about lowering your footprint for exploits, period.\r\n\r\nOn that note, if Microsoft really wanted to, they could analyze the .appx you just downloaded and pre-check it to make sure it can't use any capabilities that you did not specify in the manifest. That's what all those file system, object manager virtualization technologies allow, to intercept calls to the system and check to see if they are allowed. What this is really about is policy, and trying to get you to use their services, which isn't something that should be pushed but allow people to opt-in because it works for them. VS code is a good candidate not only because it's complex and has many moving parts that are all external to the project, but it allows Microsoft to figure out the best way to make user applications safe by default for all users, not just those on premium accounts.",

However, that is not the end of the story. \r\n\r\nThe nature of a full featured editor implies that **extension** downloading is something has to be considered if this is to be sent to the store. Do they still live on the package manager and downloaded via the software itself or do we put them in the store as extensions since the store does support software add-on. If we allow them to be downloaded though the software, is that breaking the rule that software in the store should not be downloading software? If we move the extensions to the store, that is hell of a big project, and extension developers will have to learn another way to publish. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the use on **Windows 10 S, or S mode** in the future. As we know, S mode does not allow user to install **command line tool** as those tool are destructive to the file system. Then the integrated **terminal** in vs code is rendered useless and so is the whole purpose of the software. Now should this mean Windows 10 S/S mode is not supported?

It's off-topic for this issue, but I believe these points need to be addressed. You're right that UWP is _probably_ going away, and that will _most likely_ be in favour of .NET Core (just my opinion, no insider knowledge). XAML islands and other features mean that the ideas of UWP will still live on (in the same way that the ideas of Silverlight still lived on in UWP).\r\n\r\nThe Store as a distribution model is great. The [Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) team are using it as their primary distribution merchanism. The [Powershell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) team are considering it. Both of those projects have required changes to the store to make happen, so to say that there's been no new features is just plain wrong. I don't doubt what you've heard (there's nearly 150,000 employees in Microsoft, so they won't all have the same opinion) but to ship things that are fundamental to the OS through this mechanism (not to mention all of the out-of-box apps) would suggest that it's still evolving, not being killed off.\r\n\r\nThe Store has also brought us [MSIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview) technologies, which is the deployment model and sandboxing behind the Store but without the centralised distribution.\r\n\r\nGranted there aren't any big named apps in the Store (apart from Adobe and a bunch of games) but it's still useful. Our IT department deploys more than a dozen external (and some internal) apps through the Store, that our users don't have to find, install, update or maintain in any way shape or form.

Take a look at recent events: Ad monetization is getting shut down, there was a desperate 90/10 pricing split to try to attract new developers, and Microsoft Edge recently dropped support for both UWP and the Store. MSIX works outside the Store and is primarily targeting outside the Store with it's marketing and target audience.\r\n\r\nYou might say, oh, the new Terminal is in the Store.
