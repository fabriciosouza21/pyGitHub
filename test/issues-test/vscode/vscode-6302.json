That is, clicking the scroll wheel to toggle drag scrolling. It's a useful feature to have when navigating very long files.\n\nAnd if it isn't, is there any API that would allow this to be enabled via an extension?\n\nThanks\n",

Instead because open source you say \"If you want it that bad, go ahead and make it yourself.\" But this can feel good or bad depending on person.\r\nWhat my problem with this is that I can be sure it will never be implemented / fixed. And since this functionality comes from the operating system, the fact that it was lost is actually a bug.\r\nIf we look at the numbers, people asked for this more than a year ago. There are also questions about this on other places on internet. In a year you received another 24000 issues all much more important than this one. Now you say that you need to prioritize but if that is the case there is a problem with how things are prioritized maybe.
