I was wondering if we wanted to change the boxes, arrows, and text on any roadmap, do we need to edit the JSON file manually, e.g. `public/project/frontend.json`?\r\n\r\nIs there any tool to facilitate this?\r\n\r\nIn the contribution docs, it states `Please provide a rough textual roadmap with what you have in mind with an issue and we can take it from there`. But can we add new roadmaps on a local copy of the repo, without submitting an issue? To simply get it working locally then download an image with the roadmap.\r\n\r\nI know how to change the content of the nodes with markdown. Just asking about the JSON roadmap file \ud83d\ude42.\r\n\r\nAny help is very much appreciated \ud83d\udc4d,\r\nThanks!\r\n<!-- Please enter the issue details here -->\r\n",

Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. - https://www.erlang.org/\r\n\r\nWhile initially built to tackle the requirements for the telecoms sector, we now have the same requirements for any (large scale) web application. Erlang comes with its own virtual machine (BEAM) and standard library (OTP) and is considered the most stable platform on the planet [[1]], running huge chunks of our internet, mobile phone and other telecommunications infrastructure.\r\n\r\nElixir makes the strengths of Erlang more accessible with a nicer syntax and handy additions on top.\r\nBoth [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and it's web framework [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) have been around and tested for quite some time and and there are tons of resources. Check out the Phoenix Framework web page to see the creation of a twitter-ish application including live UI updates across browsers in 15 minutes or [livebeats](https://livebeats.fly.dev/larshei).\r\n\r\nBy now, I have built a hand full web services with Elixir, and where things in other languages become difficult, erlang/elixir really shine (all those servers and services are clustered for example, without and extra tools). \r\n\r\nSome of the open source projects done by the community (and the community itself) are just awesome.\r\n\r\nElixir and Erlang are used by companies like\r\n- Discord\r\n- Ericson\r\n- Financial Times\r\n- Goldmann Sachs\r\n- PepsiCo\r\n- Pinterest\r\n- RabbitMQ -> itself powers a lot of the financial messaging on this planet\r\n- Solaris Bank\r\n- Spotify\r\n- WhatsApp\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.seppmed.de/elixir-zaubertrank-fuer-digitalisierung/\r\n",

Because the domain name is part of it. But besides it there are also things like \"protocol\" (http(s), ftp and etc.), \"port\", \"path\", \"query\" and \"fragments\". Which are quite an important part for understanding web-technology in general, both for the frontend and the backend.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53004350/152717901-c196a53f-79d0-4520-922e-2b3af656b84f.png)",

Also the guidelines did not mention the first acknowledgment. So, hopefully not causing any issues.\r\n\r\nRegarding the contribution: the added resource helped me several times to find a) a starting point on how to build an accessible web experience regarding a specific component and b) provides usually links with in-depth examples.\r\n",

I\u2019m no expert, but I was thinking that it would make sense to include a node or two about UI and UX design in the front end developer roadmap. This could include things like page design, structure, and other topics like that. Plus also the tooling to help mockup and test designs like Figma or XD. I think those things are pretty useful in becoming a successful front end developer.",

Then list AWS, GCP, and Azure's services under each of these categories. Similar to how Google Cloud compares each major cloud's services [here](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison).\r\n\r\nAnyways, just a thought as some of these roadmaps all have a relation to Cloud, so this would be a good, all-encompassing roadmap.",

They are very helpful! \r\n\r\nIf I may, I would like to suggest that Web Components could be listed along with the frameworks. Or even put on the path before the frameworks. \r\n\r\nThe reason being, Web Components are now the WHATWG/W3C standard and supported in all major browsers. As the standard, Web Components are what the companies who make the browsers strive to enable, with or without a framework. Frameworks come and go. With Web Components, the browser itself IS the framework, if you will, but without the overhead, dependencies, and learning curve of a framework. Plus, since Web Components are compatible with any framework, front-end career oriented developers still receive the knowledge/understanding/skills fundamental for other frameworks. \r\n\r\nFor all the reasons, I have been hearing/reading/seeing that more and more companies are opting for the vanilla Web Component route.  \r\n\r\nForgive me if I am preaching to the choir. \r\n\r\nThanks again for your hard work. \r\n\r\nHave a great day!

If you reach out to me with a brief detail of why and how you would like\r\nto use this content, there is a good chance that I will allow you to use it. The reason\r\nbehind this strictness in the license is to stop the people who have been using these\r\nroadmaps in ill manners e.g. ripping people off with suggesting random affiliate links,\r\nredistributing these roadmaps just for the sake of monetizing the traffic.\r\n\r\nI have tried contacting you privately (few emails, few tweets) but since it's open source might as well do it publicly\r\n\r\nI currently teach some classes at a french university (not private)\r\n\r\nI thought the roadmap was a pretty good idea and I'd like to include it in a project of mine, and then distribute it to students \r\n\r\nThe project would be open source, with the same licence as yours to be as compliant as possible. \r\n\r\nThe project itself is a website to display the roadmap in a canvas, instead of a PNG, and allow my users to click on the skills that they think they know, which would color the boxes in various colors depending on how they click, and user could export this as a PNG & a Json to share the state of their current knowledge with others. This could be useful for a number of things, including assessing before a class the current knowledge of students \r\n\r\nIt could have ads depending on hosting, or something else to cover the server costs (maybe sponsors if a company is interested...) so I think this falls under \"commercial use\" and is prevented by the licence unless I'm given explicit permission from the licence holder\r\n\r\nSo I'm coming here to ask for permission. Would you be okay with me using the project, mainly your json files?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n",

Wouldn't recommend anyone investing on it nowadays.\r\n\r\nProposition:\r\n\r\n**NoSQL Databases**\r\n - Document (MongoDB, CouchDB...)\r\n - K/V Datastores (Redis)\r\n - Column (Cassandra)\r\n - Timeseries (InfluxDB)\r\n - Realtime DBs (Firebase, RethinkDB)\r\n - Object Storage (S3, Ceph...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body":"CSS Tutorial: Inline, Internal & External CSS | Web Development Tutorials #14\n\nCSS Tutorial- Inline, Internal, and External CSS\n\nWelcome, everyone! As in the last tutorial, we have seen there are three methods of writing CSS-\u00a0Inline, Internal,\u00a0and\u00a0External.\u00a0Here, we will discuss all these three methods and do some real implementations of CSS. To start this tutorial, first, we will make a new file as\u00a0tut13.html\u00a0and add the boilerplate. For our convenience, we will give the title as\u00a0CSS Tutorial\u00a0in the <title> tag.\u00a0\n\nInline CSS\u00a0allows you to apply a unique style to one HTML element at a time. You can assign the Inline CSS to a specific HTML element by using the style attribute with any CSS properties defined within it. Let us try to understand this with an example.\n\n<body> <h1>This is CSS tutorial</h1> <p style= \u201ccolor: red;\u201d>This tutorial will teach you everything you need to know about CSS</p> </body>\n\nCopy\n\nBy writing the above code, we will see the changes as-\n\n\ufffc\n\nYou must be thinking this is the best way to add CSS on the website but I will let you know that it is not the best method to style your HTML. If you add too much Inline CSS, then your HTML will become too messy to understand for you.\n\nInternal CSS\u00a0is used to define a style tag for a single HTML page. It is defined in the <head> section within a <style> element. Let us understand the External CSS with the help of an example.\n\n<head> <style> p{ color: purple; } <style> <head>\n\nCopy\n\nBy writing the above code, we will get the output as-\n\n\ufffc\n\nOne important point to note here is, Inline CSS is given more priority than Internal CSS.\n\nExternal CSS\u00a0is mostly used when you want to make changes on multiple pages. It is an ideal condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire website by changing just one file. We will add the stylesheet in the <head> section using <link> tag.\n\n<head> <link rel= \u201cstylesheet\u201d href= \u201ctut13.css\u201d> <head>\n\nCopy\n\nThen in\u00a0tut13.css\u00a0file,\u00a0we can write our CSS-\n\np{ Color: greenyellow; }\n\nCopy\n\nBy writing this code, and linking it to the HTML file, you notice the change-\n\n\ufffc\n\nThe point here to remember is that whether it is the Internal CSS or the External CSS, whichever is written after, gets the priority. But if you want that first one should get priority, so you can add\u00a0important\u00a0after it. The result will be, it will get the most priority of all.\n\nSo I hope you must have understood all the three types of CSS used to style our website. From the next tutorials, we will see some more interesting properties about CSS. Till then stay with the tutorials and keep practicing whatever is taught till now.\n\nNo Source Code Associated With This Video\n\n",

I can also put my effort into making this system. Then we can add more features to the interactive system, at the same time users can also render an image of the roadmap like now. ",

So, I suggest there could be a list of suggested projects at each stage to help junior developers measure their progress, and articulate their skills better (sort of like gamifying it). This also helps bring juniors to build more momentum as they would feel that they completed milestones along the way, rather looking at it as a long tough road. Plus, pointing the purpose of concepts can also help make juniors really understand why concepts/techniques could help make their workflow better. \r\n\r\nThese are just some suggestions. Hopefully, it can help. \r\n\r\nI appreciate Mr.Ahmed and everyone for helping to build this wonderful project. ",

However there are a lot of reasons to pick a framework with server side templates like Rails or Django. More SEO friendly and faster time to market just to name the most important ones. Many big sites are using this approach, for example exactly this application, GitHub.\r\n\r\nSo I think this topic should be absolutely covered (on frontend and backend roadmap).",

Each of these is a different language and has different conventions.\r\n\r\nThere is some bias that C and C++ are somehow related and should be written as one term. They have as much in common as JavaScript and Java: just a part of the name, because one language was partially based on another.\r\n\r\nAdding more from Stroustrup's FAQ:\r\n\r\n> [...] people use \"C/C++\" as if it meant something specific and as if they knew what it meant, leading to much confusion and misery. People should ask \"What is C/C++?\" and then on reflection stop using the term. It does harm.\r\n>\r\n> There is no language called \"C/C++\". The phrase is usually used by people who don't have a clue about programming (e.g. HR personnel and poor managers). Alternatively, it's used by people who simple do not know C++ (and often not C either). When used by programmers, it typically indicates a \"C++ is C with a few useful and a lot of useless complicated features added\" attitude. Often, that is the point of view of people who like to write their own strings and hash tables with little knowledge of the standard library beyond printf and memcpy.\r\n\r\n**Edit: I see this issue spawned a quite discussion. Just noting that the goal of this issue is to stop using \"C/C++\" term. Currently the Dev Ops chart uses this as 1 language.**",

Obviously I already know this because every other job position says 'DevOps Engineer', whatever that means.\r\n\r\nYou are confusing it now with SRE. SRE is an actual job position (I work as SRE). At Google they say 'SRE implements DevOps' because many of the practices are fulfilled. But that's because SRE try to make developers self-service so it removes the barriers (this is the DevOps part, not the SRE position itself). And most of the time SRE come from software engineering, Google intended to apply SE to operations afterall, but it's possible to move from sysadmin.\r\n\r\n@trevorbennett That's not true at all. The industry implemented DevOps wrong. The antipatterns didn't work so now they realize that they have to apply DevOps as principles, not just add more roles. They are just shifting to implement it right now.\r\n\r\nDevOps as a role was wrong to begin with.\r\n\r\nCheck https://www.linux.com/blog/what-devops-patrick-debois-explains, the guy who coined this term.",

I completely understand what DevOps is and what it doesn't and I know that I should have better called it *Operations* or *SRE* roadmap but [look at](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=devops&location=Worldwide&locationId=OTHERS.worldwide) all the [job boards](https://www.indeed.com/q-Devops-Engineer-jobs.html) and look at the widespread misconception about it and look at the people searching for \"DevOps Engineers\", while it is not a career path it is definitely being considered as one. We can't fix the industry through this roadmap. \r\n\r\nHowever, I agree with you that we should do a better job of clarifying that in the readme and I will further explain it in the readme while I prepare the recent update.",

Just a label for a list. If that's the case, I recommend using a different visual. In every other list on the map, a grouping of boxes indicates \"probably use only one of these per project; each one addresses the same general problem.\" But here, one is free to use all of these CSS3 properties and features in the same project.\r\n\r\nI propose renaming that box to \"Advanced CSS3\" and taking the label out of the box and onto the blue arrow, just like the \"Methodologies\" label above it.

Given that the functionality either is/has a good chance of becoming the bona fide specification, we are seeing adoption.\r\n\r\nOf course, SASS and LESS are more feature rich, stable, and have significantly more adoption. However, if we are trying to prepare 2018-and-beyond front-end developers, I think cssnext and postcss are essential parts of their education.",

I'm sure years and years ago... our grandfathers built their entire house with their own two hands... plumbing, electrical, drywall, windows, floors... right?\r\n\r\nAnd while you may be able to find one person who can do those things... if you want to build for enterprise, you typically need a team -- there's simply more work than can be done by one person in the desired timeframe.\r\n\r\nI've been in the spot where I had to wear a lot of hats... I don't think it's sustainable.  For a startup especially... you're a strategist, UX designer, visual designer, architect, dev, QA, DevOps, accountant... and the guy who manages the company email server and unclogs the toilet.\r\n\r\nCan you do it in the short term?  Maybe... but should we gear people for that?  I think having one person \"do it all\" tends to be sloppy.  You don't document your work the way you would if you were on a team, you don't get input from others... just charge ahead with your own ideas.  May be good for getting to an initial launch, but chances are everything will have to be quickly torn down and rebuilt by a team.  If we want quality... we should encourage people to specialize in various areas so they can get great at those specific things.\r\n\r\nThere's just no reasonable way for someone to be great and keep up to date with DevOps and UX Design and Mobile Dev best practices all at once...  You can get to be OK at a bunch of things, but the modern economy lends itself to freelance work -- why not just call in a team of focused experts to do the job?\r\n\r\nI like the original scope of this project... I also think there's value in expanding the scope.  Been three weeks since any updates to the files were made... so it's fun to just talk with other experts too... ha!

Get familiar with Adobe Photoshop, do a deep course, learn shortcuts (!)\r\n3. Get familiar with Adobe Illustrator, do a deep course, learn shortcuts (!)\r\n4. Know the difference between Flat Design and Skeuomorphic, and it's advantages / disadvantages\r\n5. When is an app beautiful? a) symmetry b) color harmony c) composition\r\n6. Read the Google Material Design guideline\r\n7. Read the Apple iOS Human Interface guideline\r\n8. Own an Android or iOS device to get a feel what a modern app should look like\r\n9. Search and bookmark UI design pages (e.g. uimovement.com) , get inspiration a.k.a. \"steal\" designs\r\n10. Pick an example app and redesign it. Upload rough concept on Behance.net\r\n11. Build a portfolio 5-6 redesign concepts. Be active on Behance and give and receive kudos\r\n\r\n**UX ROADMAP (PSYCHOLOGY)**\r\n1. Read book \"Designing for Behavior Change\" by Stephen Wendel (!!!)\r\n2. Read book \"Hooked\" by Nir Eyal (so good!)\r\n3. Read book \"Evil By Design\" by Chris Nodder\r\n4. Read book \"Universal Principles of Design\" by Lidwell, Holden, Butler\r\n5. Read book \"100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People\" by Susan Weinschenk\r\n6.

This project claims to be a \"roadmap to becoming a web developer\", not a \"roadmap to becoming a specialist web developer at a mid-size or large company\". So you're missing some things.\r\n\r\nNot every company needs specialists. Especially smaller startups. \r\n\r\nFor instance, I work at a company with two full-time developers and an additional designer/developer combination role. We don't need more than that at the moment. We're all very efficient, but we have to be generalists because that's what our work calls for. It would slow us down massively if we had to say \"Oh, no, I can't do that. That's front-end. Give that to the other guy.\" If his plate is full, it's my work, and I get it done, and I do it well. No excuses.\r\n\r\nThe last company I was at, I was the first developer hired, and I did every technical role and sometimes non-technical stuff too, including occasionally helping on business execution strategies, product strategy, etc.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I do a lot of contract work on the side to make extra money, and I'm working on starting a side business. All of those things require me to do _everything_, perhaps minus design, but sometimes even that, just to get things done and functional for a client on a budget.\r\n\r\nThe idea of specialization only works if you already know you plan to work for a mid-size or large company with teams of a dozen or more developers working on the same product. There are plenty of those out there, but let's not pretend that's the entire marketplace, or even the vast majority. \r\n\r\nSo if you want to reflect the breadth of the marketplace, don't pretend that specialists are the only way to go these days.

      "body":"Great work on this!  Really good start.\r\n\r\nMy feedback is partially covered here: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues/33\r\n\r\nI look at this list and think, \"What would I need to know a dev could do before I felt confident hiring them?\" \r\n\r\nI'd want to see technical SEO (so like Semantic HTML, and basic knowledge of meta data for SEO and social sharing, as well as things like canonical tags, and localization tags, etc.).  I'd want to know they knew how to set up an SSL cert, and keep page load times under 3 seconds too.  I'd want them to know how to build HTML emails.\r\n\r\nI'd want to know that the dev knew something about some CMS system... if they know one they can learn another... but I'd want to know they knew how to deploy and manage one of these systems.  Sort of the basics... set up automated backups, deploy changes to a live system that has a database, how APIs work, how to set up a DNS entry, how to set up cleaning scripts for building local environments that don't strip out customer email addresses, how to install a firewall... or run SQL queries... read error logs... simple knowledge of Unix command line... basic knowledge of what AWS services do.  Simple back-end and DevOps / SecOps stuff.  I sort of look at anyone who doesn't know WordPress or HubSpot or Drupal or some CMS as having never worked on any sort of marketing system before... and that would scare me off.\r\n\r\nI want every dev to at least understand where they can go to read about coding standards, and how to validate them.  Various services they can use to make sure their code isn't sloppy... how to do an effective code review.\r\n\r\nI'd want them to know a bit about UX Design, and certainly know how to slice comps in Photoshop.  The don't have to know how to do Visual Design from scratch, but they should know the basics philosophies of \"Don't Make Me Think\" and how to give feedback to designers around points vs pixels and how to design for responsive layouts.\r\n\r\nI'd want them to know the basics about Google Analytics / business performance tracking.  Optimizely, Marketo, something like that.  They don't have to be experts, but they should be able to read a report and figure out what's happening on a page... is it the UX, is it the site performance, or is it just that users aren't converting... and to get this they just need to know the basics around a \"conversion funnel\" and the paths for how user data is captured.\r\n\r\nIf they went down the eCommerce (just another kind of CMS, really), I'd want them to know how to integrate with some basic services... email campaign service, payment gateway... these are fairly basic, but require understanding how to set up a local and various test / prod environments slightly different to utilize various service sandboxes.  I'd want them to know the basics of PCI compliance.\r\n\r\nI'd want them to know the basics of monitoring.  How to set up uptime monitors, how to set up content monitors, how to set up application performance monitors, system health monitors, security access checks...  Use of tools like New Relic... to figure out what pages need to be optimized... use of tools like Pingdom or Uptime Robot are pretty basic.... but you'd be surprised how many \"devs\" coming out of these coding academies know nothing about them.\r\n\r\nAnyway my point with a lot of this is really just that you can't do Front-end without working knowledge of a few things in DevOps and Back-End.  Certainly I agree with lines and specialization, but I never met a Front-end Dev who only did Front-end and nothing else ever.  Front-end Devs typically are on the hook for making everything work... being able to diagnose where the issues are is key for them to be successful.\r\n\r\nAre your Balsamiq files posted somewhere?  Can I make edits and suggestions directly to those files?\r\n\r\nCheers!",

And, I came here to share some suggestions.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, I build a roadmap like this with Graphviz in [https://github.com/phodal/developer](https://github.com/phodal/developer)\r\n\r\n![Dot Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phodal/developer/master/images/tree.gif)\r\n\r\nThen, newbie always like to ask books for read. So, I build a book tree to do something. [https://github.com/phodal/booktree](https://github.com/phodal/booktree)\r\n\r\nBut it's still hard to help they.\r\n\r\nSo, I build a skill tree like [https://github.com/352Media/skilltree](https://github.com/352Media/skilltree) with D3.js which is [https://github.com/phodal/sherlock](https://github.com/phodal/sherlock)\uff0c demo in here [http://sherlock.phodal.com/](http://sherlock.phodal.com/).\r\n\r\nwhen people hover the skill on roadmap in skill tree, it will show the related resources, books, articles, like this:\r\n\r\n![Sherlock D3.js](https://github.com/phodal/sherlock/raw/gh-pages/sherlock.jpg)\r\n\r\nFinally, the more and more resources add to those projects, like:\r\n \r\n - frontend & backend roadmap: [https://github.com/phodal/awesome-growth](https://github.com/phodal/awesome-growth).  \r\n - daily toolbox : [https://github.com/phodal/toolbox](https://github.com/phodal/toolbox)\r\n - practise project for newbie: [https://github.com/phodal/awesome-practise-project](https://github.com/phodal/awesome-practise-project)\r\n\r\nSo I build a app to do this [https://github.com/phodal/growth](https://github.com/phodal/growth), which you can the demo in  [http://web.growth.ren/](http://web.growth.ren/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt look like a lot of ads \ud83d\ude06 \ud83d\ude06 , don't block me.",

      "body":"Hi all, someone sent me this repo requesting comments and I wrote up a long response I thought might be useful to you. It also might not be. Yall are doing your own thing and trying to formulate a plan and that's good, I'd just like to submit this and maybe it will be helpful.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the ranting tone. It's early in the morning and I've been reading too much political news.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nFirst, I think using the term \u201cmap\u201d is problematic since it implies that you can get to or achieve the waypoints. All of these things are more \u201cdirections\u201d than destinations.\r\n\r\nNext, I don\u2019t like the idea of splitting up \u201cbackend\u201d and \u201cfrontend\u201d. \r\n\r\nI think the standard definitions that people use for this stuff are hugely problematic. If you define HTML/CSS/JS as \u201cfront end\u201d where does that leave someone who works on the iOS app for let\u2019s say \u201csimple.com\u201d? Are they not a \u201cweb developer\u201d even though they are building something that is equivalent to the website? What about someone who is working in a python templating language that spits out html/css? Where do they fall? I can keep coming up with examples.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think that exclusively focusing on one over another can be harmful. In terms of job prospects, you\u2019re going to have a *lot* more problems getting a job at a smaller company if you can\u2019t work the full stack.\r\n\r\nWorse, it is harmful for learning. A humongous part of programing on the web is really internalizing how the web/HTTP/etc works. This is the \u201cin between\u201d stuff that you\u2019re only going to learn by studying the whole process simultaneously.\r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer to talk about things functionally than as tech. \u201cBack-end developer\u201d to indicate how good someone is at understanding system architecture, performance, databases, and security; and \u201cfront-end developer\u201d to indicate to what degree someone thinks about human-computer interaction, responsiveness, UI optimization and reusability, browsers, responsiveness, and accessibility. When you formulate definitions this way you start seeing these as two largely orthogonal dimensions of a square, rather than anything mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nNow about specifics. I\u2019ll just work my way down the chart with random comments.\r\n\r\n* Splitting HTML learning from CSS is weird. I\u2019d say learn them at the same time - there\u2019s basically nothing to HTML oherwise (except forms)\r\n* Javascript _is_ es6, stop drawing a distinction and just read an essay on its history\r\n* Task runners? Gulp? Why? \r\n* Don\u2019t bother with Flux\r\n* React Angular _and_ vue? How many rabbit holes do you want to simultaneously go down? You don\u2019t know angular because you ran through the tutorial. It\u2019s a huge subject\r\n* Don\u2019t bother with Yarn until you need it\r\n* Testing should be its own thing. Specifically TDD. If you learn the tool you won\u2019t do testing and you _definitely_ will not do it to its full potential. You need to learn the philosophy.\r\n* Typescript - whatever, sure, do or do not\r\n* How is \u201cResponsive Web\u201d different from just CSS?\r\n* CSS Framework? Don\u2019t waste your time learning bootstrap. Just learn modern CSS - get comfortable with flexbox, understand the _underlying concepts_ and you\u2019ll be fine. There aren\u2019t all that many that you can\u2019t learn them in a week.\r\n* Preprocessors? Fine, but I feel like LESS is well\u2026less overhead while learning\r\n* Deep dive CSS3..first of, CSS3 has been out forever, it\u2019s just CSS now. Being aware of the fancy stuff is fine and you can look it up as needed. If you just learn the basics you\u2019ll be able to guess pretty well what features CSS has or doesn\u2019t\r\n* SVG is cool, d3 isn\u2019t necessary and isn\u2019t really tied to SVG at all, they\u2019re just often used together but either is often used separately.\r\n* SVG is something you can spend 2 days on, get the basics, and come back to  as needed\r\n* Javascript design patterns. Huh? How do you write your code without designing it? You have to think of that stuff from the outset. Also the Javascript Design Patterns book is bad and I dono\u2019t like it\r\n* Regex is a core programming concept in general, not just JS. Spend a day on it, learn the type of thing that it does, then learn more as needed\r\n\r\nBackend:\r\n* Just looking at this you can feel the cognitive weirdness as it tries to recommend _all_ the backend platforms at once. This is due to this arbitrary \u201cbackend/frontend\u201d breakdown, if the terms are to have any meaning they should be defined functionally as the type of thing you do and focus on, not tech.\r\n* Minimizing Java and C# is weird since those are the ones with the greatest demand (at least that I\u2019ve seen)\r\n* How is \u201cWeb Server\u201d a separate topic? What does that even mean? \r\n* What does \u201cRestful APIS\u201d mean?\r\n* SOLID, YAGNI, KISS are not something to just read up on at some point. YAGNI and KISS are vague guidance that you can just take as a mantra and repeat to yourself every hour. SOLID is an important thing to study that makes sense only after you\u2019ve gotten comfortable with coding and are looking to reach the next level. Its not something that you want to \u201cjust pick up at some point\u201d\r\n* Regular Expressions again! See my previous comments\r\n* Security/Authentication\u2026I guess this really depends on what exactly you mean by learning it. If you learn how the web works (which a _lot_ of people don\u2019t) you will be learning a lot on this front already\r\n* Storage - pick one RDBMS and just go with it. There\u2019s plenty to learn there without jumping all over the place. Don\u2019t pick Oracle...or probably MySql.\r\n* Why the _shit_ does everyone want to focus on MongoDb? Its an oorobooros which is only notable for the fact that it is used which it is only because it is notable.\r\n* GOF Design Patterns - you\u2019ll want to get to that sometime sooner but also it depends on the language you\u2019re using. They were written for Java and not all apply\r\n* Architectural patterns\u2026like what exactly? Learn how?\r\n* \u201cGive DDD a shot\u201d flat out offends me. If that is your attitude _you will fail_. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re making a calendar app and want to \u201cgive DDD a shot\u201d what does that even mean you do?\r\n* Also, for the love of all that is holy, if you _are_ doing DDD and reading the big DDD book - there are 2 important concepts; ubiquitous language and bounded contexts. For reasons that Eric Evans has since lamented he put the latter on chapter 17 which nobody ever gets to. Read those chapters.\r\n* Also on DDD. Don\u2019t just think that using Repository pattern means you do DDD. In fact, with modern ORMs, you probably _shouldn\u2019t_ use that pattern.\r\n* Learn different testing techniques. Yes but waaaay before this point",

There isn't much of a learning curve; one needs to start somewhere, once you have the basics out, it wouldn't be much difficult to move to something else. Look at the ecosystem, you will find tons of packages for anything you need. Agreed you can find a lot of people building crap, people asking foolish questions on stackoverflow and all that but it all boils down to the people and not the technology. You can find lots of nice stuff built in PHP as well. And surely you can find people writing crappy software in any of those cool-kid languages. For the people hating on PHP, most of them are just following the hyperbole, others who tried it years ago when it was a mess (I am not saying it has no problems now but it has namespaces, strong OO, reflection, lambdas, good frameworks, libraries, testing frameworks etc) and others hate it just because of the fanboy ego. \r\n\r\nLastly, your customers and business does not care what you use to build your app as long as it solves the problem and brings money to the table. Heck, even use Cobol if it brings you money.\r\n\r\nFor the development pace part, it is equally slow in Python, Ruby and Java (languages, libraries, frameworks, ...) or maybe even slower. It is for sure missing a few things that I would want to see but I don't think it is going anywhere any soon.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is important is to keep a healthy appetite for learning. Languages come and go, you should try not to become a language developer.

Fits your needs\r\n2. Is technically maintainable by your teams (e.g. _\"Not developed in a shitty way that implies 100% technical debt on each line of code\"_)\r\n3. Is the language you know the best\r\n\r\nToday every newcomer developer is harrassed by ego-filled guys telling that today's world is crap, past was better, and future becomes brighter with new tools.\r\n\r\nJust take the example of Docker: now, everyone wants to use docker, but **everytime** someone uses docker, its configuration is more complex to understand than the application's code it contains.\r\nJust read the [\"It's the future\" article by Paul Biggar on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/), to see how you look like by spitting on one single language like you do.\r\n\r\nNext, you talk about Node as a nice alternative and seem to think it's the best option for _\"modern development\"_.\r\nAs well as Paul Biggar's article mentioned above, feel free to read the same kind of article about Javascript development world these days, called [\"How it feels to learn Javascript in 2016\", by Jose Aguinaga](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f).\r\n\r\nEvery day you have new tools popping up in NPM registry that pretend to be the best tool for something.\r\n\r\nWith PHP, at least, you have PSRs, Composer (which is far better than NPM, thanks we have Yarn that brings up better dependency management in NodeJS...), and every framework tries to bring good development practices.\r\nOf course you can still find people doing shit with these frameworks (I've seen plenty guys doing perfect shit with Symfony, almost breaking the framework itself...), but the fact is, if you have learnt to be a _developer_ before becoming a _{whatever language} developer_, you *will* read articles about the languages/frameworks you use, you will get in touch with changelogs sometimes and conferences about new stuff, you might experience some tools in sandboxes or small projects.\r\n\r\nAnd you will realize something:\r\nThe problem almost never comes from a language or a framework.\r\nThe problem is the chair-screen interface.\r\nThe problem is human.\r\n\r\nIf you spit on a language like this, first, you receive this kind of response with so much text that I don't even think is useful at all when we see how absolute you seem to be in your opinion. Next, you will be stuck in the same narrow-minded developing strategy, and if you have to teach something to a student one day (poor him if it happens), you will tell him shit like _\"PHP is dead, don't learn it. Learn DuckmoleFrameworkJS or TranstypecompilerScript2035, it's the future.\"_. And the guy will be like _\"Ok, let's try this stuff\"_, and never think about the most important question: *Why?*.\r\n\r\nWhy do we become developers? Why do we like certain languages or frameworks more than others?\r\n\r\nWe could make a big survey about this, and I bet that if the survey is fair enough about how it's distributed (I mean, if we have an equivalent amount of PHP/Java/C/Python/whatever developers), we will have cool stats about the fact that every language is almost equivalent, with its strengths and weaknesses. And we'll see that the problem doesn't come from the language but from the developers themselves, arguing about which language is the best to learn.\r\n\r\nI recently had a tough question to ask to StackOverflow community, there:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/42761937/stateless-asynchronous-web-server-with-php-and-symfony\r\nActually my idea could be reduced to this single question: _\"When will native async PHP will be available?\"_, but I wanted _more_ than that, I wanted a debate and big answers like the ones I received, I wanted to make people explicitly say the question: _\"Why?\"_, and even if the answer is just personal (I just want PHP to allow async usage for some purpose, that's all), I now have a visible example that PHP is not the _problem_. The problem is that I want async PHP. The problem comes from the developer. (and I still would like async PHP)\r\nI'm glad of the answers because they just expose the fact that problems come from developers, not languages. My \"problem\" seem to be asked over PHP's lack of support for async, but it's just an opinion.\r\n\r\nYour problem is that you just argue that _\"PHP is bad, m'kay, you should stop usin' it, m'kay\"_.\r\n\r\nI love PHP, but I also like NodeJS, I haven't much experienced Ruby but it's interesting, and have not really used Python, but I can just say that these languages are awesome, and their frameworks too: Symfony is awesome, SailsJS is awesome, Ruby On Rails is awesome, Django is awesome, etc.\r\nWhy? \r\nBecause they are community-driven popular frameworks that have proven they can keep on making innovative stuff in this world where everything changes on every second, they are strong and secured, and the only flaw they have is that they are used by _humans_.\r\n\r\nSo the answer to the question you asked\r\n> Why is PHP involved in a roadmap with a year above 2011?\r\n\r\nIs just the following:\r\n\r\nBecause it has to.",

Sometimes I wonder if some of these new cool things are used by people to hide their inadequacies.",
